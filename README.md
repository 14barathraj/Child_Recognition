A web-based system developed to locate missing or abandoned children through facial recognition technology. 
The website serves as a critical tool for law enforcement agencies to rapidly identify and recover lost children, 
thus addressing the global issue of child trafficking and kidnapping. Leveraging advanced deep learning models for facial recognition, age estimation, and risk zone analysis, 
the suggested system develops an integrated system that links police stations, media outlets, and parents or guardians.
Our system exhibits high accuracy under various conditions in identification of children and preserves strict privacy and ethical standards. 
Experimental results provide a recognition rate of 94.2% and an average identification time of less than 3 seconds, which is notably better than existing methods.
The technology has the potential to revolutionize the way authorities deal with cases of missing children and substantially improve rates of recovery.
